# Intersection of Two Linked Lists

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

For example, the following two linked lists:

```
A:          a1 → a2
                   ↘
                     c1 → c2 → c3
                   ↗            
B:     b1 → b2 → b3
```

begin to intersect at node c1.

**Notes:**

* If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return`null`.
* The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
* You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
* Your code should preferably run in O\(n\) time and use only O\(1\) memory.

## Solution

```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
        // 1 -> 2 -> 3
        // 0 -> 1 -> 3
        // read one from A and two from B, then compare them, B will be very fast and we should discover intersection quickly
        if (headA == null || headB == null) return null;
        ListNode a = headA;
        ListNode b = headB;
        while(a != b) {
            if (a != null) {
                a = a.next;
            } else {
                a = headB;
            }
            if (b != null) {
                b = b.next;
            } else {
                b = headA;
            }
        }
        return a;
    }
}
```
