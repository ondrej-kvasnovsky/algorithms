# Binary Search Tree

[Binary Search Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree) is a data structure to store hierarchical data where each node has only two leaf nodes and nodes are sorted from left to right. BST is also called ordered or sorted binary tree.

BST is good for searching in general `O(log n)`. Heaps are the best when we want to get maximum or minimum of set of values, complexity of `O(1)`.
