# Graph

Graphs are usually stored in two ways - in a metric or in a set of nodes where each item has a references to a node it is connected with. Nice summary is in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ2Tzlxl_Xo).

## Adjacency Matrix

For undirected graph, we can keep only one side of matrix \(upper or lower\).![](/assets/Screen Shot 2018-10-12 at 10.56.28 PM.png)

## Adjacency List

Directed graph \(we can store incoming or out-coming edges\). ![](/assets/Screen Shot 2018-10-12 at 10.58.00 PM.png)

```

```

Undirected graph, each edge is stored twice.![](/assets/Screen Shot 2018-10-12 at 10.58.47 PM.png)

Adjacency matrix is bad for sparse graphs and good for dense graphs. The opposite of adjacency list.
