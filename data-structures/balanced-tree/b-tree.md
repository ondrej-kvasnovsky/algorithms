# B-Tree

[B-Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree) is self balancing binary search tree. B-Tree is mainly used for database indexes. Disk access is low compared to Red-black and AVL trees.

B-Tree is optimized to read big files and is used in databases and file systems. [Here](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1158559/B-Tree-Another-Implementation-By-Java) is detailed description of implementation details.
