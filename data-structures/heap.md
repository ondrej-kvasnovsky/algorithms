# Heap

Heap guarantees that elements on higher levels are greater \(for max-heap\) or smaller \(for min-heap\) than elements on lower levels.

Heaps are the best when we want to get maximum or minimum of set of values, complexity of `O(log n)`. Heaps require to have a priority of their nodes over their children. BST is good for searching in general, complexity of `O(1)`. More about the difference between [heap and BST](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/27860/whats-the-difference-between-a-binary-search-tree-and-a-binary-heap).

Ordered binary heap helps to implement priority queue operations.![](/assets/Screen Shot 2017-10-28 at 1.26.55 PM.png)
