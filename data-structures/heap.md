# Heap

Heap guarantees that elements on higher levels are greater \(for max-heap\) or smaller \(for min-heap\) than elements on lower levels.

Heaps are the best when we want to get maximum or minimum of set of values, complexity of `O(log n)`. BST is good for searching in general, complexity of `O(1)`.
