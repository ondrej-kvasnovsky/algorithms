# Union-Find Algorithms

### Scientific method

Steps to develop a usable algorithm using scientific method:

1. Define the problem.
2. Find an algorithm to solve it.
3. Fast enough?
4. If not, figure out why.
5. Find a way to address the problem.
6. Iterate until satisfied.

### Dynamic connectivity

Given set of N objects we support two operations: 

* Union command, that connects two objects
* Find connected objects command, that fins if two objects are connected
