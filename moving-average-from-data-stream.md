# Moving Average from Data Stream

Given a stream of integers and a window size, calculate the moving average of all integers in the sliding window.

**Example:**

```
MovingAverage m = new MovingAverage(3);
m.next(1) = 1
m.next(10) = (1 + 10) / 2
m.next(3) = (1 + 10 + 3) / 3
m.next(5) = (10 + 3 + 5) / 3
```

## Solution

```
class MovingAverage {

    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public MovingAverage(int size) {
        
    }
    
    public double next(int val) {
        
    }
}

/**
 * Your MovingAverage object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MovingAverage obj = new MovingAverage(size);
 * double param_1 = obj.next(val);
 */
```
