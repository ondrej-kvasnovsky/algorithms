# Word Break

Given a **non-empty **string_s_and a dictionary_wordDict_containing a list of **non-empty w**ords, determine if_s_can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

**Note:**

* The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
* You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet", "code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple", "pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
             Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]
Output: false
```

## Solution

```
class Solution {
    public boolean wordBreak(String s, List<String> wordDict) {
        
    }
}
```
